# DORA Metrics
DevOps Research and Assessment **(DORA)**
Unlock the potential of your DevOps team with DORA metrics. Measure deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change fail rate.

# The Four Key Metrics of DORA:

## 1. Deployment Frequency
How often are new changes deployed to production? Achieve faster innovation cycles and deliver value to users more frequently.

## 2. Lead Time for Changes
How long does it take for code changes to go from commit to production? Reduce bottlenecks and speed up the time it takes to deliver new features.

## 3. Time to Restore Service
How quickly can your team recover from incidents or failures? Improve your incident response and minimize downtime.

## 4. Change Fail Rate
What percentage of changes result in degraded services or require rollback? Enhance your stability and reliability by reducing the rate of failed changes.

# Why DORA Metrics Matter for DevOps Teams

## 1- Data-Driven Decision Making
DORA metrics provide objective insights that enable teams to make informed decisions and prioritize improvements.

## 2- Cultural Transformation
Tracking DORA metrics fosters a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration, driving innovation and high-performance.

## 3- Performance Benchmarking
Compare your team's performance against industry standards and identify areas for growth and optimization.
